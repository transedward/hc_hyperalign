# hc_hyperalign

This is a project started at 2018 [MIND](https://summer-mind.github.io/) hackthon. The purpose of this project is to investigate correlation in ensemble hippocampal (place) cells neural activity between different experimental conditions using hyperalignment.

## Entry points

### Scripts
`scripts/acr_obs` is the file for analysis for current procedure.
`scripts/acr_obs_withhold` is the file for withholding analysis.
`scripts/acr_obs_only_pca` is the file for analysis without hyperalignment.

### Simulations
`L_R_ind` is for the independent simulation.
`L_xor_R` is for the `x-or` simulation
`same_M_diff_L` is for the generation of hyper-pair.
